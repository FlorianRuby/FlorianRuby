# My Hardware
List of hardware I use. (pretty much everything is overkill ik...)
## PCs

### Main PC

- OS: Win 11 & NixOS
- CPU: Intel i7-10700kf
- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070
- RAM: 32GB (2 x 16GB) DDR4
- Storage:
  - 1 TB SSD (really bad one)
  - 1 TB HDD

### Laptop

- Model: Lenovo P1 Gen 3
- OS: Manjaro (Arch based Linux distro) & win 11 (never used it, just incase)
- CPU: Intel i9-10885H CPU @ 2.40GHz Turbo Boost 5.3GHz
- RAM: 64 GB DDR4
- Screen: 15.6' 4k OLED (I'm in love)
- Storage: 1TB SSD
  - I still have 1 free m2 slot


## Phone

- Model: iPhone 12 Pro 

(I want to switch to Android so badly but I barely use my phone so it's not worth spending the money)


I also have an iPhone 13 Pro but the sim card slot is broken so I use it as a webcam from time to time.

## Audio
As I'm collecting vinyls and also like having above average audio I listed my audiogear below. (once you've used a good headphones & AMP combo you seriously can't go back) 
- Recordplayer: Audio Technica LPX60
- Amplifier: Harman/kardon HK 3480
- Headphones: Beyerdynamics DT770
- Wireless Headphones: Sennheiser Momentum 4

_(I love them so much, couldn't live without them, however you really need to lower the base to have a good listeing experience)_
