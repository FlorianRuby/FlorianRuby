# Self-hosted Stuff
I host a number of things on my VERY OLD Raspberry Pi 3. The usage isn't that much of an issue yet (you can actually see the usage [here](https://reazn.tech/)) however I plan on upgrading my 'server' in the near future as I want to experiment more. 

## Currently I'm hosting
### Websites
* dajia.lol
* reazn.tech
* habenwirmorgenopl.info
* [Glance Dashboard](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance) - they're an opensource project with really nice config options, make sure to check them out

### Discord bots
* dajia.lol bot
* Lori bot (bleed like but with less features)
* Leurs Bot (essentially Lori bot but running on another server)
  
### Backends
* Dajia LastFm Backend (written in Rust - thank god else my RPI would be in shambles)

If anyone is interested, I'm using Cloudflared and Caddy - I used NGINX before but it was honestly hell.
